    <TD>Luke Davies-Uniacke (born 8 June 1999) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the North Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). 
        He grew up in the seaside town of Rye and attended Haileybury College. He was drafted by North Melbourne with their first selection and fourth overall in the 2017 national 
        draft. He made his debut in the sixteen point loss to Gold Coast at Cazaly's Stadium in the opening round of the 2018 season. 
        <p>North Melbourne debut: Round 1, 2018</p>
        <p>Career Brownlow votes: 7</p>
        <p>2021: After just 30 games in his first three seasons, 'LDU' managed to find some consistency with his body in 2021, playing 20 games for the year and taking his game to
             a new level. Not dropping below 17 disposals in a game over the course of the campaign, his power at stoppages and bursting speed through traffic elevated his output, 
             with the number nine now possessing the size to break games open like he did in his junior years.
        
        He played a starring role in the Round 9 victory over Hawthorn with 24 disposals and 11 clearances, while stepping up with 28 disposals against Carlton and a career-high 38 touches against the Tigers in Round 21.
        
        With another year of experience under his belt and the likes of Ben Cunnington and Jy Simpkin present to guide him, Davies-Uniacke looks set to fulfil his massive potential and continue his improvement in 2022.</TD>
